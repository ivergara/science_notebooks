    "Here we compute the transition matrix elements of a $d^4$ system like the one explored in chapter 5 for the ruthenate Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ (CRO). We compute the possible transitions of the type $d^4d^4\\rightarrow d^3d^5$, applying some knowledge regarding the allowed ground and excited states of the CRO system. The transition matrix elements obtained are then used to compute the amplitude of certain transitions corresponding to the low energy optical excitations found in CRO.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we first explore a small example to test the logic of the computation. Then, we proceed to calculate the transition matrix elements of interest.\n",

    "## Transitions for a two level and two site system with an electron on each site\n",
    "\n",
    "For a two sites $(i,j)$ and two levels $\\alpha, \\beta$ system with one electron per site, the initial states are $d_i^1d_j^1$ configurations where one electron sits on the $\\alpha$ level on each site which are $4$ in total. The final states are $d_i^0d_j^2$ configurations amounting to $5$ in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "The representation of the states used is as follows: each level/orbital is composed of two elements of an array, one for each spin (up, down). This is to say that each element of the array corresponds to a creation operator $c^\\dagger_{\\alpha\\sigma}$ when viewed from a second quantization notation. Thus, the first two elements of the array correspond to the $+$ and $-$ spin $\\alpha$ level and the following two to the $+$ and $-$ spin $\\beta$ level. To build the representation of the states of the combined two sites, we concatenate two single site arrays. This leads to an array where the first 4 elements correspond to the $i$ site and the second 4 ones correspond to the $j$ one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the state with spin up on both sites at the $\\alpha$ level, equivalent to $c^\\dagger_{i\\alpha\\uparrow}c^\\dagger_{j\\alpha\\uparrow}$, is `[1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]`. As a second example, we take the configuration where there is one spin up in each level at site $j$ whereas the site $i$ is empty `[0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0]`. For the remainder of this introduction, we will label those two configurations as `initial` and `final`, respectively."

We can easily anser that with a yes, since the receiving level $\\beta,+$ is empty in the initial state and no spin flip is involved when moving the particle from $\\alpha,+$ to $\\beta,+$. Thus, the question now is how to compute it in a systematic way. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by taking the `XOR` (exclusive or) operation between the constructed representations of the states. This means that we check where the changes between the states in question are located between the two states in question. Then, we check the positions (index) where we get a `1`, and if we find that both are odd or both are even, we can say that the transition is allowed. Whereas, if one is in odd and the other in even positions it is not allowed as it would imply a spin flip in the transition. This is equivalent as to write $<f|c^\\dagger_{i\\alpha'\\sigma}c^\\dagger_{j\\beta'\\sigma}|i>$.\n",
